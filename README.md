# GreatFrontEnd Projects Challenge - testimonial-card

This a coding challenge published in [GreatFrontEnd](https://www.greatfrontend.com) platform and it's main task is to implement a reusable, responsive testimonial card that will be used as a building block in blogs. This implementation is using Vite, Vue3 and Tailwind CSS.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
